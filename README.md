# Purpose

Given DFT + NEGF produced quantum electron transmission curves of armchair graphene nanoribbon at varying bias voltages (say from -1 V to +1 V), the 2D differential conductance plots can be found, as described in our paper: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/nn4062148 (A. C. Rajan et al. ACS nano 2014)
